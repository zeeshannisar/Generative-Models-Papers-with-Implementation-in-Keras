# **Generative Model Papers with Implementation in Keras**
This repository contains a collection of Keras implementations of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) suggested in research papers. 
All of these implementations are originally inspired from https://github.com/eriklindernoren/Keras-GAN. The notebooks with its outputs are a bit simplified version of the real code by [Erik Linder-Nor√©n](https://github.com/eriklindernoren) and can be directly tested at **Google Colaboratory**.    

New models are continously being added at daily basis.

Feel free to contact me for any query or any other implementation.
