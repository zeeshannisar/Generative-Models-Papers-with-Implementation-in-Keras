# **Generative Model Papers with Implementation in Keras**
This Repository contains a collection of Keras implementations of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) suggested in research papers. All of these implementations are originally inspired by https://github.com/eriklindernoren/Keras-GAN. The Notebooks are the simplest version of the real code by [Erik Linder-Nor√©n](https://github.com/eriklindernoren) and can be directly tested at **Google Colab Notebooks**.

New models are continously being added at daily basis.

Feel free to contact me at zshnnisar@gmail.com for any query or any other implementation.
