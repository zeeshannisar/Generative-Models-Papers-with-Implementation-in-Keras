Download any of the dataset from the link https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~taesung_park/CycleGAN/datasets/.

Make a folder named datasets in the respective repository.

Extract the downloaded data to the respective dataset folder.

I have implemented this network for MNIST dataset and BRATS 2017 dataset and these can be shared on request.
